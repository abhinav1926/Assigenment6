>> How It Works
    1. Reads incoming requests using Node.js http.createServer().
    2. For each route (like /home, /about, /contact), it serves the corresponding HTML file.
    3. CSS files are detected automatically by checking if the request ends with .css.
    4. All files are read using the fs.readFile() function and sent with appropriate content types.
    5. The 404.html page is shown for any route that doesnâ€™t match.
